In Brains in a vat Putnam argues that if an ant walks around and the path it traces happens to “draw” 
or “resemble” Churchill that doesn’t imply the image left in the sand _represents_ Churchill, because 
the ant had no way of knowing about Churchill. The same about a description of trees found in a text 
that happens to be written by monkeys randomly typing on a typewriter. The words there do not _refer_ 
to anything, says Putnam. So from a _reference_ perspective _intentio auctoris_ matters. 
(see Reason, Truth and History by Putnam, Brains in a Vat).

Now about interpretation. Let’s say there’s a culture for which a volcano is a god that communicates to the 
villagers about its mood, when the volcano is angry, there’s an eruption and so on. 
So the villagers _interpret_ different things about the world and react accordingly, 
based on how the volcano behaves, they provide sacrifices and so on. 
Clearly as per Putnam’s argument, the volcano cannot be referring to anger or any other 
kinds of moods, or cannot be demanding sacrifices, but from a semiotic perspective 
that is completely different, almost irrelevant. Semiotics is interested in the _code_ created by the villagers 
that assign meaning to the various states of the volcano, and what kind of interpretation the 
villagers do based on that code. For semiotics it is irrelevant if the interpretations are “true”, 
or can be “scientifically proved”, for semiotics what matters is that there’s a
signification system where those signs are interpreted as such by a culture. Here _intentio lectoris_ matters 
more than _intentio auctoris_. (see The Limits of Interpretation by Eco, Intentio Lectoris: The State of the Art).
